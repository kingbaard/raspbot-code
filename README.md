# Using the Docker Container

## Placing the ros2_nodes folder as /root/ros2_ws/src

This will make it so your files don't get deleted when the container ends

```sh
docker run -it --rm --privileged -v ${PWD}/ros2_nodes:/root/ros2_ws/src humble
```


## Info about sonar

* Power Supply :+5V DC
* Quiescent Current : <2mA
* Working Current: 15mA
* Effectual Angle: <15°
* Ranging Distance : 2cm – 400 cm/1″ – 13ft
* Resolution : 0.3 cm
* Measuring Angle: 30 degree
* Trigger Input Pulse width: 10uS TTL pulse
* Echo Output Signal: TTL pulse proportional to the distance range
* Dimension: 45mm x 20mm x 15mm

## To run our code

- cd into ```~/raspbot-code/```
- Build docker container
  - Run ```docker build .```
- Run docker container
  - ```docker run -it --rm --privileged -v ${PWD}/ros2_nodes:/root/ros2_ws/src <docker container id>```
- cd into ```/root/ros2_ws```
- Run: ```colcon build --symlink-install```
- Run: ```source src/source.sh```
- Run motors first. It must be running for any of the following to run.
  - ```ros2 run raspbot motors```
- To run keyboard controls (wasd for movement and any other key to stop moving):
  - ```ros2 run raspbot keyboard```
- To run square:
  - ```ros2 topic pub /drive_square_control std_msgs/msg/Bool "{ data: True }" --once```
- To run imu:
  - Make sure you are running motors
  - Then run:
    - ```ros2 run raspbot imu```
    - ```ros2 bag record position```
    - Then run the command to run the square.
  - You will now have the imu information in the same directory as you ran the record in.
  - To plot the imu graph you must:
    - Install ros-humble-rosbridge-server by running `sudo apt install ros-humble-rosbridge-server`.
    - Start the rosbridge server by running `ros2 run rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.py`
    - Start the script that will plot the data by running `python3 PositionListener.py`
    - Playback the ROS data by running `ros2 bag play <.db3 file generated by ros2 bag>`
    - Once playback is complete, interupt the script and the vizualization will appear in a new window

## Files to review

- Under artifacts
  - File called good_robit.mp4 demonstrates our robot moving in a square.
  - File called keyboard_movement.mp4 demonstrates the robot being controlled by the keyboard.
  - File called imu_plot.png demonstrates a visualization of the square manuvure
